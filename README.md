# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code. Using the starter code for the project, I inspected the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. In a Google doc, I wrote a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose in addition to if one file is dependent on another, I explained the connection.
